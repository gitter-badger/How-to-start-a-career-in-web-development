# How-to-become-a-web-developer
I would like to make a quick list of thing to learn or to do in order to help people who would like to become a web developer but don't know what to start with.
For the time being, this document is just a draft but it will improve with time. 
I will just put ideas that come from my mind and then we can organize things better. 

So I'd say one important thing is to choose your path: front end developer or back end developer?

- Learn by reading and watching tutorials, practicing code, work on personal projects, teach people what you've just learnt.
